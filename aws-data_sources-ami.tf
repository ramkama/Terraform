AWS_AMI
Use this data source to get the ID of a registered AMI for use in other resources.

## Arguments Reference ##
The following arguments are supported:

	data "aws_ami" "ami" {
		#most_recent = true
		#(Optional) If more than one result is returned, use the most recent AMI.
	
		#executable_users = ["self"]
		#(Optional) Limit search to users with explicit launch permission on the image. Valid items are the numeric account ID or self.
	
		#filter {}
		#(Optional) One or more name/value pairs to filter off of. There are several valid keys, for a full reference, check out describe-images in the AWS CLI reference.

		filter {
			name = "name"
			values = ["CentOS Linux 7 x86_64*"]
		}
	
		#name_regex = "^myami-\\d{3}"
		#(Optional) A regex string to apply to the AMI list returned by AWS. This allows more advanced filtering not supported from the AWS API. This filtering is done locally on what AWS returns, and could have a performance impact if the result is large. It is recommended to combine this with other options to narrow down the list AWS returns.
	
		#owners = ["679593333241"]
		#(Optional) Limit search to specific AMI owners. Valid items are the numeric account ID, amazon, or self.
	}

## Attributes Reference ##
The following attributes are exported:

	id						- is set to the ID of the found AMI. In addition, the following attributes are exported:
	architecture			- The OS architecture of the AMI (ie: i386 or x86_64).
	block_device_mappings	- The block device mappings of the AMI.
		block_device_mappings.#.device_name					- The physical name of the device.
		block_device_mappings.#.ebs.delete_on_termination	- true if the EBS volume will be deleted on termination.
		block_device_mappings.#.ebs.encrypted				- true if the EBS volume is encrypted.
		block_device_mappings.#.ebs.encrypted				- 0 if the EBS volume not a provisioned IOPS image, otherwise the supported IOPS count.
		block_device_mappings.#.ebs.snapshot_id				- The ID of the snapshot.
		block_device_mappings.#.ebs.volume_size				- The size of the volume, in GiB.
		block_device_mappings.#.ebs.volume_type				- The volume type.
		block_device_mappings.#.no_device					- Suppresses the specified device included in the block device mapping of the AMI.
		block_device_mappings.#.virtual_name				- The virtual device name (for instance stores).
	creation_date			- The date and time the image was created.
	description				- The description of the AMI that was provided during image creation.
	hypervisor				- The hypervisor type of the image.
	image_id				- The ID of the AMI. Should be the same as the resource id.

	image_owner_alias		- The AWS account alias (for example, amazon, self) or the AWS account ID of the AMI owner.
	image_type				- The type of image.
	kernel_id				- The kernel associated with the image, if any. Only applicable for machine images.
	name					- The name of the AMI that was provided during image creation.
	owner_id				- The AWS account ID of the image owner.
	platform				- The value is Windows for Windows AMIs; otherwise blank.
	product_codes			- Any product codes associated with the AMI.
		product_codes.#.product_code_id		- The product code.
		product_codes.#.product_code_type	- The type of product code.
